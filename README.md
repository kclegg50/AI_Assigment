Reflection
===========

  While I did get frustrated at the beginning of the assignment not understanding how to properly ask ChatGPT to write the code for me, I was amazed at the capabilities the chatbot had as I continued to give it the correct prompts. One thing that really stuck out to me was the amount of infomration it was able to produce when my prompt gave such little information. It was returning things to me I didn't necessarily ask for but was related to the prompt. There were several benefits to using the chatbot to write this code for me. The first being time. While it did take me some time to get going, after I figured it out the assigmnent didn't take too long. Another benefit I noticed was that almost all the code it gave me ran with zero errors. There was one time that it did, however it turns out to be a user error not an error with the AI. 
  I did feel as if the AI was a huge help for this project, however I could very easily see someone who isn't experienced in data science running into problems. The first problem is data bias. While it is completely unintentional AI can easily pull and use bias data from the internet or even data that you give it. The AI is trained to use the data if finds or you give it with out question. So if someone who is inexperienced with data science uses AI they might not notice the data bias the AI is using. Another problem arises from the fact that the AI will use any data. It can distinguish wether or not the data you give it is factual or not. This can lead to several incorrect findings that someone who hasn't learned data science could use and pass off creating incorrect information. It did help me to verify the AI was correct after each time I gave it a prompt. Maybe its because I just wrote a ressearch paper on AI, but I don't trust AI to always give the correct answer. I was sure it would deliever somewhat close to the correct output but I was still expecting some small errors so I would verify with Dr. Mishra's notebook.
